- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

## :mortar_board: The Idea

I've been studying and developing several projects in frontend and elaborating interfaces with figma. Recently I have been studying more about NodeJS, React, and ReactNative and I realized that these technologies make a lot of sense together so this project is a way to put into practice part of what I learned from these technologies.
