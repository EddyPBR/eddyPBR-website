- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
<br />
 
## :mortar_board: The Idea

I've been studying and developing several projects in frontend and elaborating interfaces with figma. Recently I have been studying more about NodeJS, React, and ReactNative and I realized that these technologies make a lot of sense together so this project is a way to put into practice part of what I learned from these technologies.
