# Hello World i'm EddyPBR
And this is my website/blog project to promote my work, write reviews, offer tips and demonstrate 
the results of some studies, follow me there and we will evolve together!

## The Project
This project will initially use the NodeJS, React, mongoDB, and the design has made with Figma por mim and will be hosted on the Netlify platform.

## The Idea
I've been studying and developing several projects in frontend and elaborating interfaces with figma. Recently I have been studying more about NodeJS, React, and ReactNative and I realized that these technologies make a lot of sense together so this project is a way to put into practice part of what I learned from these technologies.
